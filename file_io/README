File IO basics. 

Operations: 
  - Read
  - Write
  - Remove

Lesson learned: 
  - When creating streams, make sure to convert file path from string to char array 
    using c_str() function. 
  - Don't forget to close the file. 
  - When read from the file, make sure to check stream.good(). 
  - Don't have to check if file exists before deletion.
  - When using ifstream, do not call open().
