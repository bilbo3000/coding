BFS and DFS implementation. 

Fields: 
	-- Graph
	-- bool isVisited[MAX]
	
Operations: 
	-- Insert
	-- BFS
	-- DFS

Lesson learned: 
	-- In the constructor, make sure to class the boolean array as well 
	-- During insert, make sure not to insert node that already exist. Also, be cautious about access NULL object issue. 
	-- In BFS and DFS, use a separate boolean array to keep track of whether a node has been visited. DO NOT add another field in the node struct. 
	-- In BFS, use integer stack if node values are integer, no need to push actual node. 
	-- In BFS, only push unvisited node. 
	-- In DFS, we have DFS() and dfs();
