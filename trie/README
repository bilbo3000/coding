Trie implementation. 

Fields: 
	-- root 

Operations: 
	-- CreateNode: create a new node 
	-- AddWord: add a word to the trie
	-- CountPrefix: count the number of words in the dictionary that have a string prefix as prefix.
	-- CountWords: count the number of words in the dictionary that match exactly with a given string word.

Lesson learned: 
	-- Once a word pass a node, the prefix count of that node increase by 1. 
	-- When increment a pointer, it points to the next memory block increment by the amount of its type
	-- cout << ‘b’ - ‘a’ << endl;  The result is 1. 
	--     
const char * c = "the";   // Because string literal “the” is not supposed to be modified, thus needs to be “ const char * ”
t.AddWord(root, c);

void Trie::AddWord(Node * n, const char * word)
