Lesson learned: 
-- Check whether row and colum satisfy the requirements respectively. 
-- Flags for row and column are true initially for current element, once find a counter example for row/column, set flag to false and break immediately. 
-- Keep trying next item until either run out of elements (has no influencer) or both row and column satisfy the constraints.
