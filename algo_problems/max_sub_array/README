Lesson learned: 
-- Do not use DP. 
-- Divide and conquer seems to advanced. 
-- Use the n^2 approach, where compute the length of each (i, j) pair, and keep track of the max length and coorsponding starting and ending index. 
-- Note that the length of (i, j) is (i, j - 1) + a[j], thus we can reuse previous result rather than loop through from i to j (This would result n^3).
-- i is from 0 to n and j is from i to n --> this will take into account single element.
