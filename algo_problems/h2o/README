Lesson learned: 
-- semaphore s1 (1) makes sure only one thread access critical section. 
-- semaphore s2 (0) makes sure that consume can enter only when there are two 'H' in the buffer. 
-- s2 is release() by producer EVERY OTHER iteration --> guarentee two 'H' in the buffer. Using % to decide. 
-- Singleton pattern for critical section.
