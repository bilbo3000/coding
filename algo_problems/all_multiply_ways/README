-- Recursion. 
-- Use set of ArrayList<Integer> as history. Sort ArrayList before inserting into the history set. 
-- Carry the current ArrayList along recursive calls. 

Write a program that takes an integer and prints out all ways to multiply 
smaller integers that equal the original number, without repeating sets of 
factors.  In other words, if your output contains 4 * 3, you should not 
print out 3 * 4 again as that would be a repeating set.  Note that this is 
not asking for prime factorization only.	Also, you can assume that the 
input integers are reasonable in size; correctness is more important than 
efficiency.
