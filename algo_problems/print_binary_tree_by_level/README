Lesson: 
-- Two variables: 
    lev1: keep track of how many elements still need to process at current level. If it becomes 0, which means we have processed all elements at current level. We can print a new line and update it with number of elements in the next level (lev2); 
    lev2: number of elements we have explored so far. It will be assigned to lev1 when lev1 becomes 0.
