Longest sub-sequence problem 

Lesson learned: 
-- Dynamic programming. 
-- Distinguish sub-sequence and substring apart. 
-- T[i][j] length of the longest subsequence of a[0..i] and b[0..j] 
-- D[i][j] points to previous element that leads to T[i][j] (Table D keeps track of the path, such that we can reconstruct the longest sub sequence).
