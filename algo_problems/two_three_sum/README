Lesson learned: 
-- The sorting and two pointers approach is much better. 
-- Be careful about quick sort: 
1) Need to pass left and right to quick sort instead of size. 
2) Need to make sure right > left in QuickSort, but no need in Partition. 
3) left and right are index, donâ€™t mess up with size. 

-- Hash x - a[i] into hash table, then scan through a, if a[j] also in hash table, then find two sum equal to x.

-- Do not use this approach because it involves hashing negative numbers. 

-- In hash table: 
1) hash function takes key and generate index to hash table; 
2) Insert takes key and insert key (and associated object if exist) to HashTable; 
3) Search takes key and search the hash table. It returns the index if key matches, otherwise error out. 

-- For finding three sum: 
	1) make sure to sort the array. 
	2) right can be at most be the previous of the current element being examined.
