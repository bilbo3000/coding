Find ith smallest element from an integer array. 

Lesson learned: 
-- After partition, if the ith smallest element is on the second half, be careful that it is not ith smallest element 
  anymore on the second half, it should be i - (pivotIndex + 1) th element in the second half. And should compare 
  (pivotIndex - left + 1) with it. 
-- If there is just one element in the array, return it.
