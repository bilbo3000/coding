Priority Queue Implementation. 

Fields: 
	-- int count
	-- heap
	
Operations: 
	-- Enqueue
	-- Dequeue
	-- Bottom up heap construction, construct from an array of element
	-- Print level by level 
	-- Swap(int &a, int &b)

Lesson learned: 
	-- Elements are put into an array, relations are enforced by index
	-- floor() and pow() is in <cmath>
	-- Enqueue, Dequeue: donâ€™t forget to update count 
	-- When finding max child, make sure to check if it actually has two children
	-- Do actual swap, do not use the save approach (error prone). 
	-- Shift operator (e.g. <<), returns a value, n << 1 won't update n.
