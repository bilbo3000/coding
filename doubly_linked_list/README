Doubly Linked List implementation. 

Fields: 
-- head
-- tail

Operations: 
- Destroy
- Insert
- Delete
- Search
- Print
- PrintReverse

Lesson learned: 
- When delete last item, be careful about curr->next->back, because it does not exist!!! Also, donâ€™t forget to update tail. 
- Segmentation fault usually due to something = NULL ranther than something == NULL  !!!
