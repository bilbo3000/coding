Reorder the list such that the last node is moved after first node and the node next to the last 
is moved to after second node, so on so forth. 

-- Use stack rather than recursive calls. 
-- Traverse the list and push nodes onto stack. 
-- Then two pointers walk towards each other for the manipulation. 
-- Stop conditions is while (front != prev && front != curr).
