Dijkstra algorithm to find single source shortest path. 

Fields: 
-- Graph
-- Node 
-- Heap version and non-heap version 

Operations: 
-- 

Lesson learned: 
-- When build graph using adjacency list, adding element at the front of the list to avoid looping through the list. 
-- Each node contains a parent field on shortest path, weight, and a field of current shortest distance to source (initialized to infinity). 
-- queue doesnâ€™t have top() function, use front() instead. 
-- When BFS printing, only enqueue nodes that have not been visited. 
-- Counting number of nodes is tricky. Do not mess up with counting number of vertices.
