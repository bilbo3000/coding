From all shortest path from start to end with transformation intermediate words from a dictionary. 

Better solution: 
-- BFS. 
-- Use a HashMap<String, ArrayList<String>> to map each word to its ancestors. 
-- Toggle lev1 and lev2 between current level and next level. 
-- Remove current level from dict to avoid cycles. 
-- Recursively reconstruct the path from the map. 

Solution1.java: 
-- BFS start from end, DFS reconstruct paths. 
-- Fail on large test.
