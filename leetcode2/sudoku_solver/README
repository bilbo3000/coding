Solve a suduku. 

-- Recursion. 
-- Each recursive call, find the first empty cell, then try each digit from 1 to 9. For each digit, eheck if it is valid, 
  then recursively process the new board. 
-- Use a boolean flag to decide whether to stop. (when no more empty cell, set the flag)
-- Don't forget to reset the cell to '.' before recursion call return (only when flag is not set, otherwise, it would 
  clear out the solution)
