Find min path sum from top to bottom level of a triangle. 

Approach 1: 
-- Update level by level by calculating the min sum to each element. 
-- Return the min at last level as the final result. 
-- This approach requires modify the original triangle. 

Approach 2: 
-- Use an ArrayList p (size n + 1, initialize to 0) to keep track of the min path sum from 
  bottom level to current level (bottom up). 
-- Update p for current level based on p values obtained from previous level. 
  p[i] = triangle[i] + Math.min(p[i], p[i + 1]); 
-- Return p[0] as final result.
