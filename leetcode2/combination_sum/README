Find all combinations of an array that sum equals the target number. Each number can appear many times. 

-- Recursion. 
-- Sort the list: Arrays.sort(candidates); 
-- For each recursion call, it would have two options: 
  1. Pick current element, then recursively process the remaining array (including current element) on 
  target - current element. 
  2. Skip current element, then recursively process the remaining array (excluding current element) on 
  target.
