Determine if a binary tree is balanced (height diff of two subtrees for every node is no more than 1). 

-- Recursion. 
-- Use height function to get the height of left and right subtree. If diff more than 1, return false. 
-- Otherwise, recursion on left and right subtree and return && of the return results.
