Find the length of the longest consecurive sequence for a given array. 

-- Merge interval. 
-- Only a NEW element can connect its left and right intervals. 
-- Use a HashMap to map the length of interval start or end with that element. Note that we only care 
  about the start and the end of an interval. The length for elements within an interval doesn't matter. 
-- Merge the new element with the left interval (if exists) and update the HashMap, then merge the new left 
  interval with the right interval (if exists), also update the table. 
-- Maintain a global maximum variable.
