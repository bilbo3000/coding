Implement wildcard matching for ? and *. 

-- When see *, store the index for next char in s and the index for *. And try to skip * by incrementing j. 
-- When mismatch, restore the indexs for next char to look at in s and the index for previous stored *, as if * matches
  one more letter. 
-- Consider the cases where either i == len_s (check if s only has * left) or j == len_p (see if can restore). Accept 
  the result when both i and j equals to their corresponding length.
