Insertion sort a linked list. 

-- Loop through nodes start from the second node. 
-- For each node, check nodes in the front to find the first node that is not less than the current node, which is the 
  insert position. 
-- If no place to insert, just move on. If find place to insert, move the current node to the insertion place. 
-- After move current element, the next element becomes the new current element!
