Binary tree preorder traversal. 

-- Use a stack to store curr nodes (such that we can come back to this point). 
-- curr is a pointer to walk through the tree. 
-- while (curr != null || s.size() != 0) { ... } is the loop the walk the tree. 
  -- If curr is not null, process current node, store it in the stack and move on to left child. 
  -- If curr is null (reach leaf), pop from stack and move onto right child.
