Generate k-combinations out of 1..n

-- Recursion. 
-- The core idea is if we pick current element, we need to pick k - 1 elements from previous numbers. 
-- During current iteration, loop on i from n to k, and recursively call f(i - 1, k - 1). For the return set, append 
  i at the end of each item in the set. 
-- If k == 0, return a set with an empty item. 
-- If k > n, just return an empty set.
