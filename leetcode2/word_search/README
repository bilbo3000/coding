Find out whether a word exists in a board. Same letters cannot be used more than once. 

-- Recursion. 
-- When there is a letter match, set that position to '+' and recursively move on to its four neighbors (if matches and
  exists) in tern. 
-- Before each recursive return, set '+' back to original letter.
