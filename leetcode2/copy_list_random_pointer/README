Copy list with random pointer. 

-- Use a HashMap to map each origin node to corresponding node in the new list. 
-- Loop through origin list, if current node does not have mapping, create new node and update map. Then attach the new 
  node to the end of the new list (consider the case where head/tail== null). 
-- Similarly, for each current node, also deep copy random pointer. Also check if the random target node in the map and 
  create new random node accordingly.
