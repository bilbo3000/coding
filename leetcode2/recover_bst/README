Reconstruct the bst by swapping back two elements. 

Linear space approach: 
-- Store inorder traversal of the tree. 
-- Scan from left to right to find the left misplaced element. (first element that is greater than its neighbors)
-- Scan from right to left to find the right misplaced element. (first element that is less than its neighbors)
-- Cannot do it in one loop because there might be multiple numbers satisfy the condition, but we only want the 
  left most and right most ones.
