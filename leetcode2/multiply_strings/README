Multiply two arbitrary large positive integers represented as strings. 

-- Covnert strings to char arrays. The result should have have length of len1 + len2. 
-- Reverse arrays to make it easy to work with. 
-- Calculate digit and carry. 
-- Consider the case where carry is not 0 after each inner loop. 
-- Remove leading zeros, (consider the case where the result is 0 or multiply by 0).
