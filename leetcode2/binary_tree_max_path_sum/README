Find the max path sum of a binary tree. May start and end at any node. 

-- Recursion. 
-- Each recursion call return max path sum that go through current node. 
  Case 1: current value + return from left subtree. 
  Case 2: current value + return from right subtree. 
  Case 3: current value itself. 
  
-- Global max initialized to Integer.MIN_VALUE -2^31
-- In addition to considering the return value of above three cases, global max also needs to compare against the case 
  where the path goes through current node and lay in both left and right subtree.
