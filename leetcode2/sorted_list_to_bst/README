Convert a sorted linked list to a binary search tree. 

-- Recursion. 
-- fast and slow ptr. 
  while (fast != null) {
    fast = fast.next; 
    if (fast != null) {
      slow = slow.next; 
      fast = fast.next; 
    }
  }
-- slow points to current root. Recursion on nodes before slow and after slow. Be careful about the case where 
  slow is at the head.
