Collect values in a matrix in sprial order. 

-- Implement moveRight, moveDown, moveLeft, and moveUp methods. Use variable to determine which level it is traveling.
-- For example, for moveRight method, if x < n - 1 - level, then we can continue to move to the right. Otherwise if 
  y < m - 1 - level, we can move down. Otherwise, there is no other moves. 
-- Do not collect starting element twice in the moveUp method.
