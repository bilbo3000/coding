Generate all unique subsets of of a given set with duplicated elements. 

-- Recursion. 
-- Sort the input array: Arrays.sort(num); 
-- If element at index is not the same as element at index + 1, insert current element to all sets in the recursive 
  return results. 
-- If element at index is the same as element at index + 1, only insert current element to the sets that were introduced 
  when processing element at index + 1. 
-- The core idea is that we only need to look at the new sets that were introduced by previous same element, since 
  other sets have already been handled by that same element.
