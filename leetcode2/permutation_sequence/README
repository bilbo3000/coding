Find kth permutation for number with n digits. 

Solution 2: 
-- Mathematical
-- a_n = k / (n - 1)!
-- If k / (n - 1)! is zero, choose the smallest number that is still hasn't been used. 
-- If k / (n - 1)! is a digit that has already been used, use the smallest number that has not been used. 

Solution 1:  
-- Call next_permutation k - 1 times. 
-- Fail large tests.
