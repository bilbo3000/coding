Find the start station of a circle of gas stations. 

-- Check the total gas and total cost. If total gas is no less than total cost, it can definitely go around a circle. 
-- The idea is that if the gas-cost difference for a segment is negative, then use the station right after this 
  segment as the new start station and start with a new segment. The last such start station must be solution. 
-- If all we have seen are negative segments, the last segments must be positive and it must have enough gas to make 
  up all the negatives of previous segments. (Since total gas is known to be no less than total cost)
