Find the max length of substring that does not contain repeating characters. 

-- Maintain a window that always satisfy the constraint by using a HashTable to keep track of count of each letter 
  in the window. 
-- Push right of the window as far as possible until violates the constraint. Then move left until constraint is restored.
-- Update the max throughout the process accordingly.
