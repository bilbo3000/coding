Find the length of longest valid parentheses. 

-- Use stack. 
-- The core idea is that the last unmatched ')' or the first unmatched '(' would be used as dividers. 
-- If current is '(', push its index onto stack. 
-- If current is ')', then
  If stack is empty, update lastLeft to be current index. 
  Otherwise, pop the stack, 
    if stack becomes empty, the length would be current - lastLeft; 
    if stack is not empty, the length would be current - stack.peek();
