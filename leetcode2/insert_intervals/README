Merge the given new intervals in a list of intervals. 

-- Walk through the list until reach the end of list or there is no overlapping thereafter 
  (intervals.get(i).start > newInterval.end). 
-- For each current interval, if it overlaps with the newInterval (curr.end >= newInterval.start), extend newInterval 
  with start to be min of starts and end to be max of ends. Then remove current from the list and re-examine current 
  position. 
-- Insert newInterval at the position after loop.
