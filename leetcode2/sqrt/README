Implement sqrt(x) function. 

-- The core idea is to double the current number each iteration until first curr * curr >= x. Then do binary search 
  from prev to curr. 
-- Use long for curr and prev to avoid overflow during doubling. 
-- Same as binary search, loop condition would be while (prev <= curr). After the loop, always return curr. (like 
  always return right in binary search)
