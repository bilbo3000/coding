Find all unique combinations that sum to target. 

-- Recursion. 
-- Each recursion, loop from current element to end to exam these elements. 
-- If element at index is same as current target, add that element to the current list and return. 
-- If element at index is greater than target, skip it. 
-- If element at index is smaller than target, add it to current list and recursion on the remaining list with remaining
  target.
