Clone an undirected graph. 

-- Use a HashMap to map the origin node to new node. 
-- Use a HashSet to keep track of the history of nodes that have already been processed. 
-- DFS traverse the graph and process each node. 
-- When process a node, first create the copy of the node itself (if has not been created). Then create copies of 
  heighbors (if have not been created). After finish processing current node, put it into history set and move on to 
  next node that has not been processed.
