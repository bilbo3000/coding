Partition a list to move elements that are smaller than x before elements that are greater than while retain relative order. 

-- Similar to quicksort partition. 
-- last points to last element that is smaller than x. Consider when tail == null.  
-- prev, curr traverse the list. Consider when prev == null. 
-- When prev == last, no need to move. Just need to updates pointers.
