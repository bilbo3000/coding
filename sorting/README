Sorting algorithms. 

Fields: 
	-- int arr[MAX]; 
	-- int size; 

Operations: 
	-- Mergesort (sort array and linked list)
	-- Quicksort (linear scan approach, two pointer approach is buggy)
	-- Heapsort
	-- Selection sort 
	-- Insertion sort 
-- Bucket sort 
	-- Radix sort 
	-- Counting sort 
	-- PrintArray

Lesson learned: 

Mergesort: 
	-- Array is passed by reference void Test(int arr[]), what actually passed is int *
	-- Be careful about floor() and ceil() function. If doing ceil(5/2), the result would be 2 rather than 3!!!
	-- When loop through linked list, make sure to update curr pointer. 
	-- Make sure run mergesort only when size > 1

Quicksort: 
	-- each local function call should realize the global index, since its in place. 
	-- Linear scan approach will use the last element as pivot
	-- Do not use the two pointer approach, it is buggy. 

Heapsort: 
	-- When doing heapify, make sure to use boolean “isHeap” to stop the loop. 

Insertion sort: 
	-- Use actual swap is safer 
	-- If use the save approach, make sure to compare with the saved value.
