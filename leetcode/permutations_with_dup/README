Lesson: 
-- Recursive. 
-- Recursive on the elements start from the second element. 
-- For the results returned from recursive calls, insert current at each position and use a history set to keep track of what we have seen. 
-- If it is new, update the history and insert into result set. 
-- Return result set.
