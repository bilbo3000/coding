Lesson: 
-- Use doubly linked list to represent the cache. 
-- The head of the linked list would always be the MRU. 
-- The tail of the linked list would always be the LRU.
-- Use a map to map keys to each node (for quick look up). 
-- When accessing an element: 
    0) if doesn't exist, return -1. 
    1) if it is the head --> do nothing; 
    2) if it is the tail --> move to head and update head, tail. 
    3) if it is somewhere in the middle --> move to head and update head. 
-- When setting an element: 
    1) if doesn't exist, create new node and insert at the front of the list, 
    update the map. 
    ATTENTION: if exceeds the limit, needs to delete tail from the list. DO NOT
    forget to delete the entry in the map (each node would have a key field 
    and a value field). 
    2) if already exist, set new value, move to head, and update head. (update
    tail if it is tail).
