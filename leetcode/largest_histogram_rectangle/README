Lesson: 
-- Clever use of stack. 
-- The core idea is to finalize the max area limited by each element. 
-- The stack is used to keep track of the elements where the area limited by each element 
  may still grow. (In creasing order, this would help us find the left bound index of area
  limited by current top of stack). 
-- Walk through each element. If current element is greater than or equal to tos, simply push it onto stack. 
  This still guarantees that the max areas limited by each element in the stack may still grow. 
-- If current element is less than tos, then pop out previous elements that is larger than 
  current element and compute the max area that is limited by each previous element (using current element
  and next element on as right bound and left bound respectively). This makes 
  sense because current element is appearantly a bottom neck on the right (because it is smaller
  than current tos). The next element on the stack is guarantee to be the left bottom neck because
  it MUST be smaller than all elements that is after it and up to current element, otherwise, it 
  would already be cleared out. 
-- Also note that the only element in the stack is guaranteed to be the smallest element we have 
  encountered so far, otherwise, it would be cleared out by smaller elements.
