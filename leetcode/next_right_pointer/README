Lesson learned: 
-- Use a vector and a stack. 
-- Vector stores elements at current level as children. 
-- Stack stores elements at previous level as parents (transfered from the vector). 
-- vector .end() does not point to the last element. do v.erase(--v.end()) to remove the last element from the vector. 
-- Cannot use [] to retrieve elements from stack.
