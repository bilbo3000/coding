Find the largest rectangle in a histogram represented as a list of numbers. 

-- Use stack to store indexs. 
-- Insert 0 at the beginning and the end. 
-- For each element, if it is >= the top of stack, push the index. 
-- Otherwise, clear out all the elements that are greater than current element. Meanwhile, calculated the right area (look
  at current index) and left area (look at top of stack) of the cleared out element. 
-- Update max accordingly.
