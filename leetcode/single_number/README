Lesson: 
Approach 1: 
-- Hash each number to a hash table; 
-- If first time, set value to 1; 
-- If not first time, increment value; 
-- Then, walk through the hash table to see if any value is and return the key

Approach 2: 
-- Use XOR. 
-- Elements that appear twice would cancel out and won't appear in the final result, only the single number would appear in the final result.
