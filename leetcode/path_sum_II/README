Lesson learned: 
-- Do it recursively using a helper function. 
-- Keep track of the path along the way. 
-- When reach a leaf and its value is equal to the sum, then insert path into result set. 
-- If not a leaf, insert current value into path, decrement sum by its value and recursive on left and right child with new path and new sum.
