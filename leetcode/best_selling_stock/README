Lesson learned: 
-- Dynamic programming
-- Two transactions cannot overlap --> split into history and future at each time point. 
-- history[] --> max profit up to this point (whether new values are high enough to sell). 
-- future[] --> max profit start from this point (whether new values are low enough to buy).
