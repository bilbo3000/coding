Lesson: 
-- Recursion + backtracking. 
-- For given current string, try all possible prefix that are palindromes. Add the current palindrome prefix to a vector and pass down the vector to the recursive call that process the remaining parts. 
-- Make sure that when the recursive call returns, pop_back() the prefix from the vector such that the next palindrome prefix can be added. 
-- During recursive calls, when there is no string to process, insert current vector (which contains one valid partition) into result set.
