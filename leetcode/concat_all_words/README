Lesson: 
-- Use a table "needToFind" to specify the number of each string we need to find. 
-- Walk i from 0 through S.size() - cnt * len. 
-- For each i, starts a j walks from i to i + cnt * len (increase by len each 
    iteration) and use a table 
    "hasFound" to keep track of how many elements (in needToFind has already 
    been found).
-- If we found each substring in the list exactly once (done by a counter). 
    Insert i to result. 
-- If any of the following conditions is met, try next i: 
    1) substring starts at j with length len does not exist in needToFind. 
    2) Found something more times than what it should appear (by comparing 
    hasFound value with needToFind value).
