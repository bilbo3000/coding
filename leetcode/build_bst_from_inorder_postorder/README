Lesson: 
-- In post order traversal, the root would always be the last one. 
-- Once we got the root from post order, we can find that root in inorder 
    traversal and recursively process left subtree and right subtree. 
-- Make sure to pass vector as reference to recursive calls to avoid it creates vector for each recursive call, which would waste lots of memory.
