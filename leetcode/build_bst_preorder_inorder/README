Lesson: 
-- Recursion. 
-- The first element in the preorder traversal must be the root. 
-- Use a map to map the value to its index for the inorder traversal. 
-- Once we obtain the root from the preorder, we can find the index of root from the map and 
  able to partition the inorder and preorder into two subtrees. 
-- Pass vectors, maps by reference to save space. 
-- Be careful about manipulating index.
