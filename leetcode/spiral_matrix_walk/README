Lesson: 
-- Do it level by level (level from 0 to (min(row, col) - 1) / 2). 
  Note that we use the minimun of row and col to be the level. 
  
-- Need to take care of the corner cases where: 
  1) eventually only one element (can be handled by the following cases); 
  2) eventually only one row (this only happens when odd number of rows, and when level == row / 2); 
  3) eventually only one column (this only happens when odd number of cols, and when level == col / 2);
