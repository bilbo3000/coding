Lesson learned: 
-- Find the node where to start to reverse. (curr points to the nth node). 
-- Reverse until curr pass the mth node (use a counter to keep track of which node curr is pointing to). 
-- Use ALeft, Aright, BLeft, BRight to point to the four nodes to be break (just more clean).
-- If ALeft if NULL, make sure to update head!!!
-- Make sure do null check before calling stuff like curr->next.
