Lesson: 
-- Tree --> recursion. 
-- Let the recursive function return the max single path sum that rooted at current root. 
  It could go in the left subtree. 
  It could go in the right subtree.
  It could also just be the root itself (in the case where both left and right path sums are 
  negative). 
-- We need to return the maximum of above three. 
-- It must go through the current root in order to make up a path. 
-- In the case where the maximum path sum completely lay in some substree, we need to have a 
  global variable to keep track of the overall maximum path sum. For this case, we need to 
  consider an additional case where the path lay in both left and right subtree and go 
  across the current root.
