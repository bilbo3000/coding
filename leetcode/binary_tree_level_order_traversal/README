Lesson: 
-- prev and curr pointers. 
-- If prev == NULL, curr is a start of a new line. Push another NULL into queue to indicate the start of next line. Insert an empty vector to result. 
-- If current is not NULL, insert its value into the last vector of result and push it children if they are not empty.
