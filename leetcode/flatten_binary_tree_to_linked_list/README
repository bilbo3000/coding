Lesson: 
-- Iterative pre order tree walk. 
-- while (curr != NULL || s.size() != 0)
-- For each curr node: 
    1) if NULL, pop and make prev->right = curr; 
    2) if not null: 
        -- push curr->right if not NULL; 
        -- move curr->left to curr->right (this is fine since curr->right has been saved on the stack)
        -- Don't forget to set curr->left to NULL (save it before set to NULL). 
        -- Move to the saved curr->left.
