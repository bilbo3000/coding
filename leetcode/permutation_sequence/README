Lesson: 
-- Generate next permutation k - 1 times and return the generated permutation. 
-- Core idea of generating next permutation: 
    1) Find the last s[i] < s[i + 1]. If cannot find, it means there is no next permutation. The idea is that we want to find the last opportunity to make an increment.
    2) Find the last s[j] > s[i]. The idea is we want to increase by least amount. 
    3) Swap s[i] and s[j]. 
    4) Reverse the substring after i. This makes the least increment.
