Lesson: 
-- The basic idea is to count the number of consecutive digits. 
-- Whenever the current char is different from the previous one, it indicates the start of a new segment. Then compute output and reset the counter. 
-- Make sure to take care of the last char. (Checking current char with next char seems to be better). 
-- Append char to string: s + 'a'
-- Convert integer to char: (char)(i + '0')
