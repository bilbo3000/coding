Lesson: 
-- Use a hash table to map each node in the original list to the corresponding
  node in the new list. 
-- For each node in the original list; 
  1) if it does not exist in the map (means the corresponding new node has not 
  been created yet), create corresponding new node and append to the end of new 
  list. And update the mapping. 
  2) if it exists in the map, no need to create the new node in the new list. 
  3) if random pointer is not NULL, check the mapping, if random target already 
  exists, just update the random pointer for the node in the new list, otherwise, 
  create the random pointer target node and update the random pointer and also the 
  table.
