Lesson: 
-- Dynamic programming. 
-- T[i]: the minimum jump to current position. 
-- T[i] is equal to the min of T[j] where 0 <= j < i and A[j] can reach A[j] in ONE step (+1 step)!!!
-- We only need to look at A[j] that can reach A[i] in one step because if A[j] can reach
  A[i] in two steps, it will just jump from j to some place (say k) where k can jump to i in  
  one step, we will just look at k rather than j. That is why we are able to just look at j's 
  that can reach i in just one step.
