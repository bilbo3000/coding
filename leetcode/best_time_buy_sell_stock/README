Lesson: 
Approach 1: 
-- O(N^2)
-- For each price, check the delta with the min prices before. That is the profit if selling at 
  that day. Store the profit for each day. 
-- Find the max amoung all the profits. 

Approach 2: 
-- O(N)
-- The core idea is to scan through the price array. 
-- If current price is less than the current min 
  price, this price cannot be a sell. We make it to be the new min price. 
-- Otherwise, we find the delta between current price with the current min. If delta is greater than 
  current max, we update the max. 
-- Key: each node needs to find the delta with the current min. We need the largest one.
