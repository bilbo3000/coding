Lesson learned: 
-- Find all overlap intervals and replace them with one merged interval where start is the min of all mins and max is the max of all maxs. 
-- Make sure to insert the new interval after the last overlap interval and then remove all the overlap intervals. 
-- If two boundaries are the same, they are also considered as overlap. 
-- When loop from higher to lower index, make sure to do i--, rather than i++. 
-- Insert and erase of a new element at given position in a vector: 
vec.insert(vec.begin() + index, new_item);
vec.erase(vec.begin() + index);
