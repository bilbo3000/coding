Lesson: 
-- The core idea is to check borders. For each 'O' that is on the border, run DFS to mark all 'O'
  that are connected to this 'O'. These 'O' should not be captures. 
-- Note that if a 'O' has been marked, we do not need to continue DFS from that cell thereafter. 
-- Then, loop through the board to capture all 'O' that are not marked (means they are not 
  connected to borders).
