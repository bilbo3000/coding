Lesson: 
-- The core idea is for each position, find the max height on the left and on the right 
  respectively. 
-- The water can appear on the current position is min(leftmax, rightmax) - curr_height
-- This makes sense because the water level can possible go over current position is limited by 
  min(leftmax, rightmax). The amount of water at current position is decremented by the height 
  of current position.
