Lesson: 
-- Recursion + dynamic programming
-- Table T[i][j] is used to keep track of whether s1[i..] and s2[j..] would 
	be interleaving string with s3. T is initialize with size s1.size() + 1
	and s2.size() + 1 and all true.  
-- Each iteration, check T first before move on. 
-- If current front letter in s1 matches current front letter in s3, match,
	increment both pointers and recursively process the remaining strings.
	Set corresponding field in T if it fails. 
-- If that fails, and current front letter in s2 matches current front letter 
	in s3, match, and increment both pointers and recursively process the 
	remaining strings. 
	Set corresponding field in T if it fails. 
-- If all fails, return false and set corresponding bit in T.
