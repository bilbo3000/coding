Lesson: 
-- Use a stack. 
-- Walk through the input: 
  1) If current element is a number, push onto stack. 
  2) If current element is an operator, pop two numbers from the stack to op2 and op1. 
  3) Calculate op1 op op2, push the result back to the stack. 
-- After running the algorithm, return the element left in the stack as result.
