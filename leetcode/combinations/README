Lesson: 
-- Recursion. 
-- If k == 1, means select 1 out of n elements. So create a vector of vectors with 1 element in each vector. 
-- If k > 1, recursively process the remaining part for each i from n to k --> select k - 1 element out of i - 1 elements where i could range from current n to current k. 
-- For each recursive return result, insert current element into each return vector. 
-- sort(vec.begin(), vec.end()) --> sort vector.
