Lesson: 
-- Use two pointers prev and curr to walk the list. 
-- curr points to the first element and delete all the duplicates behind it. 
-- Use a boolean variable to indicate whether any duplicates has been deleted. When false, just advance prev and curr. 
-- However, if true, need to delete curr by using prev. --> need to consider the cases where delete head and delete somewhere in the middle.
-- When calling curr->next, need to check curr != NULL. When calling curr->next-val, need to check curr->next != NULL.
