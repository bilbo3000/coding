Lesson learned: 
-- Recursion on first half and the second half of the vector of ListNodes. 
-- Merge the return results from both recursive calls. 
-- During the merge, ALWAYS consider the situation where the return value is NULL. For example, when head/tail == NULL, head/tail->next would cause compile error.
