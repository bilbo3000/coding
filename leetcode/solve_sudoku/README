Lesson: 
-- Recursion. 
-- The core idea is that: 
    -- For current board, find first empty cell. (Note that if no more empty, 
        which indicates we have already found a solution, just return true.
        This is true because by that time, all the filled cells are valid). 
    -- Try to place 1 to 9 at that cell while make sure placing that number 
        is a valid move. (Note that here we only need to check current row, 
        current column, and current quadrant, because only they can be 
        impacted by current cell). 
    -- If valid move, recursively process the new board. 
    -- If not valid move, try next number. 
    -- If all number are invalid. Reset current cell and return to upper level.
    -- Make sure to pass board by reference to speed up.
