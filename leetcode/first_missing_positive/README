Lesson learned: 
-- The idea is put positive number n to its correct position (at index n - 1). 
-- When looping through elements, must satisfy four conditions: 
    1) Must be positive (A[i] > 0); 
    2) Must within range (A[i] - 1 < n); 
    3) Does not at right position (i != A[i] - 1); 
    4) Do not swap same element (A[A[i] - 1] != A[i]), otherwise, it will just keep swapping!!!

-- Use while statement to loop through array. DO NOT forget to update counter each iteration. 
-- After each swap, make the counter still point to the current element by decrement counter. Because we want to examine this new element.
