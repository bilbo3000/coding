Lesson: 
-- Use a hash table to map old nodes to new nodes. 
-- Use a history set to keep track of nodes that has already been visited. (A node is said to be visited 
  means that itself and its children are cloned). 
-- Use recursion to run DFS to clone each node. 
-- For each node, clone current node. If it does not exist in the mapping, create corresponding new node
  and update the mapping. Then clone the children list. If a child does not exist in the mapping, create 
  corresponding child node and update the mapping. 
-- Once finish processing a node, update history set. Do not process a node that is in the history set. 
-- Then, recursively process each child node in the children list.
