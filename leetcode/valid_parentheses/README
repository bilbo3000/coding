Lesson: 
-- Use stack. 
-- If current char in the input string is a opening parenthesis, push onto stack. 
-- If current char is a closing parenthesis, and it FORMS A PAIR with the top of the stack, pop the top of stack. 
-- Otherwise return false; 
-- After scanning for loop, return false if stack is not empty.
