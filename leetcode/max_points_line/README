Lesson: 
-- O(n^2)
-- The core idea is that for each point p as origin, figure out the maximum number of points among all the other points 
  that lay on the lines that goes through p. Therefore, we only need to care about slope. 
-- We don't need to actually calculate the slope. If the same slope, we can get the g = gcd(x_diff, y_diff) and 
  x_diff/g, y_diff/g pairs should be the same for all points with same slope. Thus we know they are on the same line. 
  We can thus use that pair as the key to the hash table. 
-- Use gcd would also be able to handle points lay on the lines that parallel to x-axis (y_diff == 0) and parallel 
  to y-axis (x_diff == 0). 
-- Euclid gcd algorithm: 
 int gcd(int a, int b) {
  if (a == 0) return b; 
  if (b == 0) return a; 
  
  return gcd(b, a % b); 
 }
 
 If gcd(a, b) == 0, then both a and b must be 0.
