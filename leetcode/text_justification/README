Lesson learned: 
-- Scan through each word and decided if this word can fit into current line. 
-- if fit --> insert into current line set, advance line length by 
    1) wordLength when just fit; 
    2) wordLength + 1 otherwise; 
-- if not fit --> process current line, by calculating space number, space in between, and extra space. 
-- If a line only contains a single word, filled the rest of space with empty space. 
-- Don't forget to handle the last line.
