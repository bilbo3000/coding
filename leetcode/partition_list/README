Lesson: 
-- First time scan through the list to find out the length and tail. 
-- Second time walk through the list, after process each node, decrement the length counter (stop until 0 --> all nodes have been processed), otherwise, it won't stop. 
-- During second walk, if current element >= target, move it the tail. Attension: 
    1) if current node is head --> update head; 
    2) if current node is tail --> update tail; 
    3) if current node is somewhere in the middle --> regular case.
