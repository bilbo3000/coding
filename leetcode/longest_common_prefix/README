Lesson learned: 
-- Use Trie. 
-- Each node keeps tracks of the number of string that passes that node. 
-- Then walk through the edges when cnt == strs.size() and collect char until cannot move further.
-- Convert char to string: 
    char c = 'a'; 
    stringstream ss; 
    ss << c; 
    string str; 
    ss >> str;
