Lesson: 
-- If the total gas is greater than or equal to the total cost, it is definitely able to make a 
  cycle. We only need to figure out where to start. 
-- For the current starting index (s), we keep track of how many gas left in the tank. If at station 
  i it becomes negative, it means it cannot make it from s to i + 1. Put another word, the segment
  [s..i] consumes gas rather than produce gas, thus, we try i + 1 to be the next starting station 
  and reset the tank. 
-- By doing so, the last starting station would be the overall starting station. The core ideas is 
  that the last segment must be able to produce at least the amount of gas as the amount consumed
  by previous negative segments (because total >= 0!).
