Lesson learned: 
-- Two pointers, fast and slow. fast start with the second node, slow start with the first node. 
-- Make sure to consider the cases where: 
    1) list is empty; 
    2) list has one node (point to itself); 
-- Each iteration, move fast first, if equal slow, return true. Otherwise, move both slow and fast.
