Lesson: 
-- Use two pointers. 
-- Not necessary to use recursion. Two pointers start from two ends and move towards each other. Each time it will point to next char. 
-- Meanwhile, upper case letters will be converted to lower case letters. 
-- If both letter match, advance both pointers. Otherwise, return false.
