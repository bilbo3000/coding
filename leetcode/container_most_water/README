Lesson: 
-- Two pointers start from two side. 
-- Calculate current area: min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i), update max area is greater than it. 
-- Advanced the shorter side. 
-- The key idea is that iff advance the shorter side gives the opportunity to increase the area. 
  Advance the longer side would only reduce the area!!!
