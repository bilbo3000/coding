Lesson: 
-- Recursion. 
-- For each element in the set, to see if any of it can be the current element. 
-- Recursive on the remaining set start from the next element. 
-- Pass current collection along the way. When current element is equal to target, insert current collection into the result set. 
-- Make sure to continue the searching even it finds a solution.
