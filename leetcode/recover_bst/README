Lesson: 
-- Do inorder tree traversal of the bst. 
-- Find the two elements that have been swapped: 
  1) Element a[i] where (i == 0 && a[i] > a[i + 1) || (i < n - 1 && a[i] > a[i + 1] && a[i - 1] < a[i + 1])
  2) Element a[j] where (j == n - 1 && a[j] < a[j - 1]) || (j > 0 && a[j] < a[j - 1] && a[j - 1] < a[j = 1])
-- The key idea is to find the element that is larger than the element follow it and the one 
  before it is smaller than the one after it. Also find the element that is smaller than the element
  before it and the one before it is smaller than the one after it.
