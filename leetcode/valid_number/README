Lesson: 
-- Clever use of regular expression. 
-- String regex = "\\s*[+-]?(\\d+\\.?|\\d*\\.\\d+)(e[+-]?\\d+)?\\s*";
-- Leading and tailing white spaces do not take into account. 
-- Before the whole number and before the exponential number, there would be an optional +,- sign. 
-- A number could have a dot. Something like 0, 0., 0.0, .0 .
