Lesson: 
-- When need process a linked list in some sort of reverse fashion, consider using recursion. Maybe pass something along the way as reference so it can walk backwards. 
-- Recursively process the list and pass a count variable as reference along the way. 
-- When it hits the end of the list, start increment the count and backtrack. When count == n, delete the node. 
-- Note that we also need to pass the current node as previous node to the next recursive call such that the recursive can delete next node if necessary.
-- WARNING: before each iteration call returns, need to increment cnt. Otherwise, all nodes would be deleted !!!
