Lesson: 
-- Recursion. 
-- If two strings have different length, they cannot be scramble string. return false. 
-- If two string have same length, but constains different set of letters, they cannot be 
  scramble string, return false. (This step is important for speeding up). 
-- Then check if current two strings are equal. If yes, return true. 
-- Otherwise, try all possible splits of s1, then recursively compare it with the same split of 
  s2 or the "swap-split" of s2 to see if both halves are scramble string.
