Lesson: 
-- Clever use of DP. 
-- The core idea is to maintain "hang-lines" and to see how far each hang-line
    can push to both left and right. From that information, we can calculate 
    each area and thus obtain the maximal area. 
-- H[j]: the length of hang-line ending with the element in the jth column at 
    current row. 
-- L[j]: the index of first valid element the current element at jth column 
    can push to the left. 
-- R[j]: the index of first invalid element the current element at jth column 
    can push to the right. 
-- Thus, for current element matrix[i][j]: 
    1) calculate L[j]
    2) calculate R[j] and get the area. 
-- Note that when calculate L[j] move from left to right because we need to 
    use a variable to keep track of the first valid element to the left 
    in the stripe. 
    When calculate R[j], we move from right to left because we need to use 
    a variable to keep track of the first invalid element to the right in 
    the stripe.
