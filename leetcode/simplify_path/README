Lesson: 
-- Use stack to keep track all the name in the path. 
-- i loop through the string, if it is a '/', use j to extract the name of that segment. 
-- string cannot be NULL. 
-- s[i] return a char, so do comparison with char: s[i] == '.', not s[i] == ".". 
-- When generate the path off the stack, append "/" + stack.top() at the front of the result.
