Linked List implementation. 

Fields: 
-- head 
-- tail 

Operations: 
	- Print list
	- Destroy the list 
	- insert a node 
	- delete a node 
	- search a given item

Lesson learned: 
- insert: 
	1) list is empty; 
	2) Not empty, smaller than the first item, need to update head; 
	3) Not empty, larger than all items, need to update tail; 
	4) Not empty, somewhere in the middle; 

- delete: 
	1) list is empty; 
	2) delete the first node, need to update head; 
	3) delete somewhere in the middle; 
	4) not empty, but not in the list; 

- When destroy the list, don't forget to reset tail to NULL. 

- Always provide destructor!!!

- If delete last item, don't forget to update the tail pointer.
