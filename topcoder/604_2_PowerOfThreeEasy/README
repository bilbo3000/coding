Robot moving in a coordinate either up (increase y) or right (increase x). At step k, the robot must 
move 3 ^ k units. Determine if the robot can reach a given coordinate. 

The idea was to do BFS until either find the target coordinate or next level becomes empty. Note that 
do not add invalid coordinate to next level during each iteration.
