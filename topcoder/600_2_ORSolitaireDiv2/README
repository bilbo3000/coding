Find minimum number of elements to remove from an array of numbers such that OR any number of the 
remaining elements won't produce the target number. 

The first step was to convert each element in the array to bit vector. (matrix)
Also, convert the target number to bit vector as well. 
Use a counting array to count the number of bits hit on each index by accumulating corresponding bits 
from the elements in the input array. Note that we ignore elements that introduce bits that fall 
out of bits masked by target number. Put another way, we only count elements that contributes a 
subset of bits of the target number. The reason is that those elements won't be OR anyway, thus can 
be safely ignored. 
The last step is to find the minimum number in the count array, and that will be the minimum number 
need to be removed. Make sense, because remove those elements that cover that bit, OR any elements 
won't produce the target number.
