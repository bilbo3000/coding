Given a board, represented by 0 and 1. Find the area of largest chess board. 

The same idea as hang line approach when find largest area of zeros in a board. 
At each level, if current digit is different from the one above, increase the length of hang line 
at that position by 1. Otherwise, reset the length of hang line at that position to 1. 
After updating hang lines, push each hang line to the left and to the right as much as possible. 
Either out of bound, or hang line too short cannot push, or digits are the same. Then calculate the
area which is the product of hang line and the length after push. Update global result accordingly.
