Find the largest long that satisfies t^2 + t <= d. 

Binary search. 
Lower starts from 0 and upper starts from d. It makes sense because the value has to fall into this range. 
Each iteration, check the middle element to see if it satisfy the condition. Meanwhile, use a separate 
variable to keep track of most recent solution. 
If found a solution, store it, and set lower to one above it to search for next closer solution. 
Otherwise, which mean current value is too large. Set upper to one below it and start a new iteration.
