Given a list of points lie on a plane, determine the number of triangles formed by any three points 
that contains the origin in the triangle. 

The idea was to examine every single triple of points (3 layers of nested for loops). For each triangle, 
use "cross product side" algorithm to determine whether a given point (the origin) falls into the triangle. 
The reason behind the "cross product side" algorithm is that if a point fall into a triangle, the cross 
product of two vectors (one edge and the vector to that point) should have the same sign for all three edges. 
Could be all negative or all positive.
