Given one permutation of 1 through N with some missing digits and the number of pairs such that S[i] < S[j] when i < j, find 
all possible ways to fill the missing digits. 

Brute force approach. Try all possible ways to fill the list. For each way, check the sortedness 
number by scanning through all possible pairs.
