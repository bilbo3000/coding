Given two lists of strings, concatenate strings into one. And count the number palindromic substrings in a string. 

The idea was to using StringBuilder to concatenate strings then using a two dimension table to keep 
track of whether T[i][j] is palindromic or not. After finish building the table, count the number of 
elements in the matrix are set to be the number of palindromes in the table.
