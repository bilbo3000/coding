Given an int array. Keep picking two distinct integers from the array. Divide the large one by the 
small one. If the result does not exist in the array, add it to the array. Repeat this process until 
there is nothing can be added. Find the number of elements in the array in the end. 

The idea was to use a set as the history to keep track of all distinct elements in the array. Also 
sort the list each time. Each iteration use two for loops to iterate through the list, start from 
the end of list (because new element would be added to the end of the list). The termination condition
is the size of list no long changes. This can be achieved by using a variable to store previous list 
size. Return the list size in the end.
