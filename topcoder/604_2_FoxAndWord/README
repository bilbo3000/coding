Given a list of Strings, find the number of unique pairs such that the second word can be formed by 
split and swap the first word. The idea was that first sort the input list such that same strings 
all fall into a cluster. Then loop through the list (skip duplicated words). For each word, try to 
pair it with each word behind it (also skip duplicated words). For each pair, try all possible 
split-swap.
