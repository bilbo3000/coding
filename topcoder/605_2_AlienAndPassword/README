A password is formed by delete a character from a String. Find the number of unique password it could 
have for a given String. The idea was to use a set to keep track of the history. Then try to delete 
each each character from the string (via StringBuilder). If the resulting string is nevern seen before,
then increment the counter and add it to the history set.
