// SRM 178 Div2
Find the number of strings that does not contain "ab" for given length. 

-- Dynamic programming. 
-- T[i] is the number of strings contain "ab" for strings with length i. 
-- T[i] = T[i - 1] * 3 + Math.pow(3, i - 2) - T[i - 2] 
-- T[i - 1] * 3 means the last position can be a, b, or c. Math.pow(3, i - 2) - T[i - 2] means the last two 
  positions are "ab" and there is no "ab" in with length i - 2. 
-- Don't forget to subtract T[i - 2] to avoid duplicate counting. 
-- The final result is Math.pow(3, length) - T[length].
