Find the number of all permutation of a list of wolves by swapping consecutive positions. 
Note that two wolves can be swapped iff the sum of their sizes is less than the given max sum.

The idea was to permute position index, rather than the value, because walves with the same sizes 
are considered different. Use a set to keep track of the history. Each iteration, scan through 
newly added permutation, until there are no new permutations are added. For each permutation, try 
to swap each consecutive positions and store the result if it is not in the history. At the end, 
all permutaiton would be in the history set.
