Give a list pile of stones, each trip can only move exact two stones at a time. Find the minimum
trips such that each pile contains the same number of stones. 

The idea was to get the sum first and divide by the number of piles. If is is divisible (remainder is
0), then it is possible to make such a move. 
Next step is to loop through the piles and look at piles with more than average number of stones and 
determine how many trips it can offer. Add up that number in the final result.
