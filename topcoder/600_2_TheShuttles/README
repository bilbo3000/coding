All shuttles would have the same number of seats. The cost for each shuttle is calculated as 
baseCost + x * seatCost, where x is number of seats. Number of employees at each location is stored in an array. 
Each shuttle can only go to one location. Find the min cost. 

The idea is that the number of seats can only ranges from the min to the max number of employees at 
each location. Try each number of seats per bus and calculate coresponding cost. Keep track of the min
cost while calculating.
