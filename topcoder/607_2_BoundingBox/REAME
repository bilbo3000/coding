Find the smallest area of a rectangle such that all given points fall into the box. 

The idea was to scan through the list of points and keep tracking of the left-most/right-most 
x coordinates and top/bottom y coordinates. The resulting area would the product of the x-coordinate 
difference and the y-coordiante difference absolute value.
