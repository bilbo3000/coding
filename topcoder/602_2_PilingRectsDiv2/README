Give a list of rectangles (represented by two edges) and a limit, find the max number of rectangles 
that overlap to produce an intersection area that is at least limit. Note that rectangles can rotate. 

The idea was to loop through the rectangles and for each rectangles, there are two options. First 
option was to join all possible previous choices. In order to join a previous choice, the overlap 
area of current rectangle and the previous overlap area must at least be as large as limit. In addition
a rectangle can rotate, which both should be considered. The second option is to start a new sequence
with current rectangle. Note its area must be at least as large as the limit. 
Maintain two lists, one keep track of the current sizes of each choice sequence. The second list keeps 
track of the current two edges that contributes the overlap area (Min x and min y). Update the second 
list accordingly.
