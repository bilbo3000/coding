Find the number of integers between left bound and right bound such that the integer 
is square of some integer, such as 1, 4, 9, 16, etc. 

The idea was to start from the left bound and found the first integer that is the 
square of another integer. (One can take the square root of the integer and then 
restore the square of that resulting square root to see if the result is the same 
as original integer. If yes, then it is a square integer.) Next step is to increase 
the square root by one during each iteration until the square of that number exceeds 
the right bound. Count the number of square root along the way.
