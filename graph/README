Graph implementation 

Fields: 
-- Array of Node pointers
 
Operations: 
	- DFS (recursion)
	- BFS (Queue)
	- Clear graph
	- Insert
	- Print graph

Lesson learned: 
	- The index of the pointer array represents the value of the nodes. 
	- When working with linked list, make sure to explicitly consider insert into empty list. 
	- When inserting (x, y), make sure also insert (y, x). 
	- When inserting something that already exist, do not insert again. 
	- If using Graph g; then use g.PrintGraph(); If using Graph * graph = new Graph(); then use g->PrintGraph();
