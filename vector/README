Vector implementation. 

Fields: 
	-- array
	-- size  // How many elements in the vector 
	-- space   // How many space are allocated 

Operations: 
	-- operator[]
	-- Insert
	-- Delete from given index 
	-- PrintVector

Lesson learned: 
	-- Using class template and method template
	-- Member functions are considered as function templates, thus their implementation requires template attribute, but no the definition in the class. 
	-- In the implementation of a class template, make sure the class name before scope resolution operator :: has template tag such as “MyClass<T>::”
	-- Overload operator[]
	template <class T> 
	T Vector<T>::operator[](int index) { … }
